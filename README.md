# AI-Q-Learning-Algorithm
This repository contains a copy of a project that I wrote the Q-Learning Algorithm for.

I wrote the Q-Learning Algorithm for a maze agent that starts at one point on the board, and is told where to go by utilizing an AI model. I wrote the code that logs the episodes that take the agent from A to B. Utilizing this amount of help, we can see that the algorithm can perform great mathematical equations with little to no effort and still be completely CORRECT.

Computer scientists make it possible for humans to connect to the internet. This matters, as it is currently one of the only ways to allow people to collaborate over long distances and utilize this conept for the furthering of scientific studies.

When I am approaching a problem as a computer scientist, I make sure to listen to anything and everything that pertains to the problem at hand. The more information that you can recieve the better.

My ethical responsibilities as a computer scientist range from courtesy. I need to protect the users from other users and themselves. Another big thing to do is make reminders about why you need the current reminder, and an explanatioin for both the user and the person that may view my code after I have completed the work that needed to be do. Protecting the end user is one thing, but another is the company that you work for. In order to keep working for a company, the company needs to be a thing. The best way to keep working for a company is to ALWAYS do your best work and assume that every line of code that you write is the last time that will touch it.
